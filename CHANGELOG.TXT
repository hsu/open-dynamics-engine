 [-]  Fixed bug with storage memory not being properly zeroed at allocation.

 [*]  Memory customization changed to match assertion failure handler 
      customization. Now it is not necessary to save original pointers,
      just NULL-s are to be assigned to revert from customized to
      default memory menager.
